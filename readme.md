## Continuous Integration
- Our project uses Git flow to manage version of source code.
  
We proceed with all developments in the develop branch. When our incremental is ready for deployment, we merge it to the release branch and then test it. After all the tests pass, we merge to master branch to provide to other users.

- Our project uses Travis for continuous integration.

When we push to the develop branch, the Travis automatically performs the test. If all the tests pass, Travis automatically merge our commit into the release branch.
